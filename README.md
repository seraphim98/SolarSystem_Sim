# SolarSystem_Sim
N-Body simulation of the solar system (Classical)
This script aims to simualte the orbits of the planets of the Solar System. This is done through the assumption that the Sun 
dominates and all other gravitational influences are negilible. It also only considers classical physics and does not correct for discrepancies in Mercury's
orbit.

Next Steps:
Account for other gravitational forces
Change visualisation to outer planets.
Have an animated output
Attempt to include relativistic correction when calculating forces on Mercury
